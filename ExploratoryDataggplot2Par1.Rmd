## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

| In another lesson, we gave you an overview of the three plotting systems in R. In this lesson we'll focus on the third and newest
| plotting system in R, ggplot2.  As we did with the other two systems, we'll focus on creating graphics on the screen device rather than
| another graphics device.

...

  |======                                                                                                                            |   5%

| The ggplot2 package is an add-on package available from CRAN via install.packages(). (Don't worry, we've installed it
| for you already.) It is an implementation of The Grammar of Graphics, an abstract concept (as well as book) authored and
| invented by Leland Wilkinson and implemented by Hadley Wickham while he was a graduate student at Iowa State. The web
| site http://ggplot2.org provides complete documentation.

...

  |==========                                                                                                                        |   7%

| A grammar of graphics represents an abstraction of graphics, that is, a theory of graphics which conceptualizes basic
| pieces from which you can build new graphics and graphical objects. The goal of the grammar is to “Shorten the distance
| from mind to page”. From Hadley Wickham's book we learn that

...

  |=============                                                                                                                     |  10%

| The ggplot2 package "is composed of a set of independent components that can be composed in many different ways. ... you
| can create new graphics that are precisely tailored for your problem." These components include aesthetics which are
| attributes such as colour, shape, and size, and geometric objects or geoms such as points, lines, and bars.

...

  |================                                                                                                                  |  12%

| Before we delve into details, let's review the other 2 plotting systems.

...

  |===================                                                                                                               |  15%

| Recall what you know about R's base plotting system. Which of the following does NOT apply to it?

1: Use annotation functions to add/modify (text, lines, points, axis)
2: It is convenient and mirrors how we think of building plots and analyzing data
3: Can easily go back once the plot has started (e.g., to adjust margins or correct a typo)
4: Start with plot (or similar) function

| Recall what you know about R's lattice plotting system. Which of the following does NOT apply to it?

1: Plots are created with a single function call (xyplot, bwplot, etc.)
2: Can always add to the plot once it is created
3: Most useful for conditioning types of plots and putting many panels on one plot
4: Margins and spacing are set automatically because entire plot is specified at once

| Keep up the great work!

  |=========================                                                                                                         |  20%

| If we told you that ggplot2 combines the best of base and lattice, that would mean it ...?

1: Like lattice it allows for multipanels but more easily and intuitively
2: Its default mode makes many choices for you (but you can customize!)
3: All of the others
4: Automatically deals with spacings, text, titles but also allows you to annotate

Selection: 3

| You got it!

  |=============================                                                                                                     |  22%

| Yes, ggplot2 combines the best of base and lattice. It allows for multipanel (conditioning) plots (as lattice does) but
| also post facto annotation (as base does), so you can add titles and labels. It uses the low-level grid package (which
| comes with R) to draw the graphics. As part of its grammar philosophy, ggplot2 plots are composed of aesthetics
| (attributes such as size, shape, color) and geoms (points, lines, and bars), the geometric objects you see on the plot.

...

  |================================                                                                                                  |  24%

| The ggplot2 package has 2 workhorse functions. The more basic workhorse function is qplot, (think quick plot), which
| works like the plot function in the base graphics system. It can produce many types of plots (scatter, histograms, box
| and whisker) while hiding tedious details from the user. Similar to lattice functions, it looks for data in a data frame
| or parent environment.

...

  |===================================                                                                                               |  27%

| The more advanced workhorse function in the package is ggplot, which is more flexible and can be customized for doing
| things qplot cannot do. In this lesson we'll focus on qplot.

...

  |======================================                                                                                            |  29%

| We'll start by showing how easy and versatile qplot is. First, let's look at some data which comes with the ggplot2
| package. The mpg data frame contains fuel economy data for 38 models of cars manufactured in 1999 and 2008. Run the R
| command str with the argument mpg. This will give you an idea of what mpg contains.

> str(mpg)
Classes ‘tbl_df’, ‘tbl’ and 'data.frame':	234 obs. of  11 variables:
 $ manufacturer: chr  "audi" "audi" "audi" "audi" ...
 $ model       : chr  "a4" "a4" "a4" "a4" ...
 $ displ       : num  1.8 1.8 2 2 2.8 2.8 3.1 1.8 1.8 2 ...

| Nice work!

  |=========================================                                                                                         |  32%

| We see that there are 234 points in the dataset concerning 11 different characteristics of the cars. Suppose we want to
| see if there's a correlation between engine displacement (displ) and highway miles per gallon (hwy). As we did with the
| plot function of the base system we could simply call qplot with 3 arguments, the first two are the variables we want to
| examine and the third argument data is set equal to the name of the dataset which contains them (in this case, mpg). Try
| this now.

> qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg)

| You're the best!

  |============================================                                                                                      |  34%

| A nice scatterplot done simply, right? All the labels are provided. The first argument is shown along the x-axis and the
| second along the y-axis. The negative trend (increasing displacement and lower gas mileage) is pretty clear. Now suppose
| we want to do the same plot but this time use different colors to distinguish between the 3 factors (subsets) of
| different types of drive (drv) in the data (front-wheel, rear-wheel, and 4-wheel). Again, qplot makes this very easy.
| We'll just add what ggplot2 calls an aesthetic, a fourth argument, color, and set it equal to drv. Try this now. (Use
| the up arrow key to save some typing.)

> qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, color = drv)

| You are doing so well!

  |================================================                                                                                  |  37%

| Pretty cool, right? See the legend to the right which qplot helpfully supplied? The colors were automatically assigned
| by qplot so the legend decodes the colors for you. Notice that qplot automatically used dots or points to indicate the
| data. These points are geoms (geometric objects). We could have used a different aesthetic, for instance shape instead
| of color, to distinguish between the drive types.

...

  |===================================================                                                                               |  39%

| Now let's add a second geom to the default points. How about some smoothing function to produce trend lines, one for
| each color? Just add a fifth argument, geom, and using the R function c(), set it equal to the concatenation of the two
| strings "point" and "smooth". The first refers to the data points and second to the trend lines we want plotted. Try
| this now.

> qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, color = drv, geom = c("point", "smooth"))

| You got it right!

  |======================================================                                                                            |  41%

| Notice the gray areas surrounding each trend lines. These indicate the 95% confidence intervals for the lines.

...

  |=========================================================                                                                         |  44%

| Before we leave qplot's scatterplotting ability, call qplot again, this time with 3 arguments. The first is y set equal
| to hwy, the second is data set equal to mpg, and the third is color set equal to drv. Try this now.

> qplot(y = hwy, data = mpg, color = drv)

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |============================================================                                                                      |  46%

| What's this plot showing? We see the x-axis ranges from 0 to 250 and we remember that we had 234 data points in our set,
| so we can infer that each point in the plot represents one of the hwy values (indicated by the y-axis). We've created
| the vector myhigh for you which contains the hwy data from the mpg dataset. Look at myhigh now.

| You are amazing!

  |===============================================================                                                                   |  49%

| Comparing the values of myhigh with the plot, we see the first entries in the vector (29, 29, 31, 30,...) correspond to
| the leftmost points in the the plot (in order), and the last entries in myhigh (28, 29, 26, 26, 26) correspond to the
| rightmost plotted points. So, specifying the y parameter only, without an x argument, plots the values of the y argument
| in the order in which they occur in the data.

...

  |===================================================================                                                               |  51%

| The all-purpose qplot can also create box and whisker plots.  Call qplot now with 4 arguments. First specify the
| variable by which you'll split the data, in this case drv, then specify the variable which you want to examine, in this
| case hwy. The third argument is data (set equal to mpg), and the fourth, the geom, set equal to the string "boxplot"

> qplot(drv, hwy, data = mpg, geom = "boxplot")

| You are quite good my friend!

  |======================================================================                                                            |  54%

| We see 3 boxes, one for each drive. Now to impress you, call qplot with 5 arguments. The first 4 are just as you used
| previously, (drv, hwy, data set equal to mpg, and geom set equal to the string "boxplot"). Now add a fifth argument,
| color, equal to manufacturer.

> qplot(drv, hwy, data = mpg, geom = "boxplot", color = manufacturer)

| You are really on a roll!

  |=========================================================================                                                         |  56%

| It's a little squished but we just wanted to illustrate qplot's capabilities. Notice that there are still 3 regions of
| the plot (determined by the factor drv). Each is subdivided into several boxes depicting different manufacturers.

...

  |============================================================================                                                      |  59%

| Now, on to histograms. These display frequency counts for a single variable. Let's start with an easy one. Call qplot
| with 3 arguments. First specify the variable for which you want the frequency count, in this case hwy, then specify the
| data (set equal to mpg), and finally, the aesthetic, fill, set equal to drv. Instead of a plain old histogram, this will
| again use colors to distinguish the 3 different drive factors.

> qplot(hwy, data = mpg, fill = drv)
`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

| You got it right!

  |===============================================================================                                                   |  61%

| See how qplot consistently uses the colors. Red (if 4-wheel drv is in the bin) is at the bottom of the bin, then green
| on top of it (if present), followed by blue (rear wheel drv). The color lets us see right away that 4-wheel drive
| vehicles in this dataset don't have gas mileages exceeding 30 miles per gallon.

...

  |==================================================================================                                                |  63%

| It's cool that qplot can do this so easily, but some people may find this multi-color histogram hard to interpret.
| Instead of using colors to distinguish between the drive factors let's use facets or panels. (That's what lattice called
| them.) This just means we'll split the data into 3 subsets (according to drive) and make 3 smaller individual plots of
| each subset in one plot (and with one call to qplot).

...

  |======================================================================================                                            |  66%

| Remember that with base plot we had to do each subplot individually. The lattice system made plotting conditioning plots
| easier. Let's see how easy it is with qplot.

...

  |=========================================================================================                                         |  68%

| We'll do two plots, a scatterplot and then a histogram, each with 3 facets. For the scatterplot, call qplot with 4
| arguments. The first two are displ and hwy and the third is the argument data set equal to mpg. The fourth is the
| argument facets which will be set equal to the expression . ~ drv which is ggplot2's shorthand for number of rows (to
| the left of the ~) and number of columns (to the right of the ~). Here the . indicates a single row and drv implies 3,
| since there are 3 distinct drive factors. Try this now.

> qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, facets = . ~ drv)

| That's a job well done!

  |============================================================================================                                      |  71%

| The result is a 1 by 3 array of plots. Note how each is labeled at the top with the factor label (4,f, or r). This shows
| us more detailed information than the histogram. We see the relationship between displacement and highway mileage for

| Now we'll do a histogram, again calling qplot with 4 arguments. This time, since we need only one variable for a
| histogram, the first is hwy and the second is the argument data set equal to mpg. The third is the argument facets which
| we'll set equal to the expression drv ~ . . This will give us a different arrangement of the facets. The fourth argument
| is binwidth. Set this equal to 2. Try this now.

> qplot(hwy, data = mpg, facets = drv ~ ., binwidth = 2)

| That's correct!
