## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

| In another lesson, we gave you an overview of the three plotting systems in R. In this lesson we'll focus on the base
| plotting system and talk more about how you can exploit all its many parameters to get the plot you want.  We'll focus
| on using the base plotting system to create graphics on the screen device rather than another graphics device.

...

  |===                                                                                                              |   3%

| The core plotting and graphics engine in R is encapsulated in two packages. The first is the graphics package which
| contains plotting functions for the "base" system. The functions in this package include plot, hist, boxplot, barplot,
| etc. The second package is grDevices which contains all the code implementing the various graphics devices, including
| X11, PDF, PostScript, PNG, etc.

...

  |=====                                                                                                            |   5%

| Base graphics are often constructed piecemeal, with each aspect of the plot handled separately through a particular
| function call. Usually you start with a plot function (such as plot, hist, or boxplot), then you use annotation
| functions (text, abline, points) to add to or modify your plot.

...

  |=======                                                                                                          |   6%

| Before making a plot you have to determine where the plot will appear and what it will be used for.  Is there a large
| amount of data going into the plot? Or is it just a few points? Do you need to be able to dynamically resize the
| graphic?

...

  |=========                                                                                                        |   8%

| What do you think is a disadvantage of the Base Plotting System?

1: It mirrors how we think of building plots and analyzing data
2: It's intuitive and exploratory
3: A complicated plot is a series of simple R commands
4: You can't go back once a plot has started

Selection: 4

| That's correct!

  |==========                                                                                                       |   9%

| Yes! The base system is very intuitive and easy to use. You can't go backwards, though, say, if you need to readjust
| margins or have misspelled a caption. A finished plot will be a series of R commands, so it's difficult to translate a
| finished plot into a different system.

...

  |============                                                                                                     |  11%

| Calling a basic routine such as plot(x, y) or hist(x) launches a graphics device (if one is not already open) and draws
| a new plot on the device. If the arguments to plot or hist are not of some special class, then the default method is
| called.

...

  |==============                                                                                                   |  12%

| As you'll see, most of the base plotting functions have many arguments, for example, setting the title, labels of axes,
| plot character, etc. Some of the parameters can be set when you call the function or they can be added later in a
| separate function call.

...

  |===============                                                                                                  |  14%

| Now we'll go through some quick examples of basic plotting before we delve into gory details. We'll use the dataset
| airquality (part of the library datasets) which we've loaded for you. This shows ozone and other air measurements for
| New York City for 5 months in 1973.

...

  |=================                                                                                                |  15%

| Use the R command head with airquality as an argument to see what the data looks like.

> head(airquality)
  Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
1    41     190  7.4   67     5   1
2    36     118  8.0   72     5   2
3    12     149 12.6   74     5   3
4    18     313 11.5   62     5   4
5    NA      NA 14.3   56     5   5
6    28      NA 14.9   66     5   6

| You are quite good my friend!

  |===================                                                                                              |  17%

| We see the dataset contains 6 columns of data. Run the command range with two arguments. The first is the ozone column
| of airquality, specified by airquality$Ozone, and the second is the boolean na.rm set equal to TRUE. If you don't
| specify this second argument, you won't get a meaningful result.

> range(airquality$ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
[1]  Inf -Inf
Warning messages:
1: In min(x, na.rm = na.rm) :
  no non-missing arguments to min; returning Inf
2: In max(x, na.rm = na.rm) :
  no non-missing arguments to max; returning -Inf

| Try again. Getting it right on the first try is boring anyway! Or, type info() for more options.

| Type range(airquality$Ozone,na.rm=TRUE) at the command prompt.

> range(airquality$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
[1]   1 168

| You're the best!

  |=====================                                                                                            |  18%

| So the measurements range from 1 to 168. First we'll do a simple histogram of this ozone column to show the distribution
| of measurements. Use the R command hist with the argument airquality$Ozone.

> hist(airquality$Ozone)

| You are doing so well!

  |======================                                                                                           |  20%

| Simple, right? R put a title on the histogram and labeled both axes for you. What is the most frequent count?

1: Under 25
2: Over 150
3: Between 60 and 75
4: Over 100

Selection: 1

| You got it right!

  |========================                                                                                         |  21%

| Next we'll do a boxplot. First, though, run the R command table with the argument airquality$Month.

> table(airquality$Month)

 5  6  7  8  9 
31 30 31 31 30 

| That's correct!

  |==========================                                                                                       |  23%

| We see that the data covers 5 months, May through September. We'll want a boxplot of ozone as a function of the month in
| which the measurements were taken so we'll use the R formula Ozone~Month as the first argument of boxplot. Our second
| argument will be airquality, the dataset from which the variables of the first argument are taken.  Try this now.

> boxplot(Ozone~Month, airquality)

| You are amazing!

  |===========================                                                                                      |  24%

| Note that boxplot, unlike hist, did NOT specify a title and axis labels for you automatically.

...

  |=============================                                                                                    |  26%

| Let's call boxplot again to specify labels. (Use the up arrow to recover the previous command and save yourself some
| typing.) We'll add more arguments to the call to specify labels for the 2 axes. Set xlab equal to "Month" and ylab equal
| to "Ozone (ppb)". Specify col.axis equal to "blue" and col.lab equal to "red". Try this now.

> boxplot(Ozone~Month, airquality, xlab = "Month", ylab = "Ozone (ppb)", col.axis = "blue", col.lab = "red")

| You got it!

  |===============================                                                                                  |  27%

| Nice colors, but still no title. Let's add one with the R command title. Use the argument main set equal to the string
| "Ozone and Wind in New York City".

> boxplot(Ozone~Month, airquality, xlab = "Month", ylab = "Ozone (ppb)", col.axis = "blue", col.lab = "red", main = "Ozone and Wind in New York City")

| Keep trying! Or, type info() for more options.

| Type title(main="Ozone and Wind in New York City") at the command prompt.

> title(main = "Ozone and Wind in New York City")

| You got it!

  |=================================                                                                                |  29%

| Now we'll show you how to plot a simple two-dimensional scatterplot using the R function plot. We'll show the
| relationship between Wind (x-axis) and Ozone (y-axis). We'll use the function plot with those two arguments (Wind and
| Ozone, in that order). To save some typing, though, we'll call the R command with using 2 arguments. The first argument
| of with will be airquality, the dataset containing Wind and Ozone; the second argument will be the call to plot. Doing
| this allows us to avoid using the longer notation, e.g., airquality$Wind. Try this now.

> with(airquality, plot(Wind, Ozone))

| Nice work!

  |==================================                                                                               |  30%

| Note that plot generated labels for the x and y axes but no title.

...

  |====================================                                                                             |  32%

| Add one now with the R command title. Use the argument main set equal to the string "Ozone and Wind in New York City".
| (You can use the up arrow to recover the command if you don't want to type it.)

> title(main = "Ozone and Wind in New York City")

| Excellent job!

  |======================================                                                                           |  33%

| The basic plotting parameters are documented in the R help page for the function par. You can use par to set parameters
| OR to find out what values are already set. To see just how much flexibility you have, run the R command length with the
| argument par() now.

> length(par())
[1] 72

| Excellent job!

  |=======================================                                                                          |  35%

| So there are a boatload (72) of parameters that par() gives you access to. Run the R function names with par() as its
| argument to see what these parameters are.

| You nailed it! Good job!

| Variety is the spice of life. You might recognize some of these such as col and lwd from previous swirl lessons. You can
| always run ?par to see what they do. For now, run the command par()$pin and see what you get.

> par()$pin
[1] 7.645417 3.837083

| That's correct!

  |===========================================                                                                      |  38%

| Alternatively, you could have gotten the same result by running par("pin") or par('pin')).  What do you think these two
| numbers represent?

1: Plot dimensions in inches
2: Coordinates of the center of the plot window
3: A confidence interval
4: Random numbers

| Now, run the command par("fg") or or par('fg') or par()$fg and see what you get.

> par("fg")
[1] "black"

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |==============================================                                                                   |  41%

| It gave you a color, right? Since par()$fg specifies foreground color, what do you think par()$bg specifies?

1: Better color
2: Background color
3: blue-green
4: Beautiful color

Selection: 2

| That's a job well done!

  |================================================                                                                 |  42%

| Many base plotting functions share a set of parameters. We'll go through some of the more commonly used ones now. See if
| you can tell what they do from their names.

...

  |==================================================                                                               |  44%

| What do you think the graphical parameter pch controls?

1: plot character
2: pc help
3: point control height
4: picture characteristics

Selection: 4

| Almost! Try again.

| The p stands for plot.

1: pc help
2: point control height
3: plot character
4: picture characteristics

Selection: 1

| Not quite right, but keep trying.

| The p stands for plot.

1: picture characteristics
2: pc help
3: plot character
4: point control height

Selection: 3

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |===================================================                                                              |  45%

| The plot character default is the open circle, but it "can either be a single character or an integer code for one of a
| set of graphics symbols." Run the command par("pch") to see the integer value of the default. When you need to, you can
| use R's Documentation (?pch) to find what the other values mean.

> par("pch")
[1] 1

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |=====================================================                                                            |  47%

| So 1 is the code for the open circle. What do you think the graphical parameters lty and lwd control respectively?

1: line slope and intercept
2: line length and width
3: line type and width
4: line width and type

Selection: 3

| Keep up the great work!

  |=======================================================                                                          |  48%

| Run the command par("lty") to see the default line type.

> par("lty")
[1] "solid"

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |========================================================                                                         |  50%

| So the default line type is solid, but it can be dashed, dotted, etc. Once again, R's ?par documentation will tell you
| what other line types are available. The line width is a positive integer; the default value is 1.

...

  |==========================================================                                                       |  52%

| We've seen a lot of examples of col, the plotting color, specified as a number, string, or hex code; the colors()

| What do you think the graphical parameters xlab and ylab control respectively?

1: labels for the x- and y- axes
2: labels for the y- and x- axes

Selection: 1

| You nailed it! Good job!

| The par() function is used to specify global graphics parameters that affect all plots in an R session. (Use dev.off or
| plot.new to reset to the defaults.) These parameters can be overridden when specified as arguments to specific plotting
| functions. These include las (the orientation of the axis labels on the plot), bg (background color), mar (margin size),
| oma (outer margin size), mfrow and mfcol (number of plots per row, column).

...

| The last two, mfrow and mfcol, both deal with multiple plots in that they specify the number of plots per row and
| column. The difference between them is the order in which they fill the plot matrix. The call mfrow will fill the rows
| first while mfcol fills the columns first.

| So to reiterate, first call a basic plotting routine. For instance, plot makes a scatterplot or other type of plot
| depending on the class of the object being plotted.

| As we've seen, R provides several annotating functions. Which of the following is NOT one of them?

1: points
2: text
3: lines
4: title
5: hist

Selection: 5

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |====================================================================                                             |  61%

| So you can add text, title, points, and lines to an existing plot. To add lines, you give a vector of x values and a
| corresponding vector of y values (or a 2-column matrix); the function lines just connects the dots. The function text
| adds text labels to a plot using specified x, y coordinates.

...

  |======================================================================                                           |  62%

| The function title adds annotations. These include x- and y- axis labels, title, subtitle, and outer margin. Two other
| annotating functions are mtext which adds arbitrary text to either the outer or inner margins of the plot and axis which
| adds axis ticks and labels. Another useful function is legend which explains to the reader what the symbols your plot
| uses mean.

| Before we close, let's test your ability to make a somewhat complicated scatterplot. First run plot with 3 arguments.
| airquality$Wind, airquality$Ozone, and type set equal to "n". This tells R to set up the plot but not to put the data in
| it.

> plot(airquality$Wind, airquality$Ozone, type = "n")

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |==========================================================================                                       |  65%

| Now for the test. (You might need to check R's documentation for some of these.) Add a title with the argument main set
| equal to the string "Wind and Ozone in NYC"

> title(main = "Wind and Ozone in NYC")

| That's a job well done!

  |===========================================================================                                      |  67%

| Now create a variable called may by subsetting airquality appropriately. (Recall that the data specifies months by
| number and May is the fifth month of the year.)

> may <- subset(airquality, Month == 5)

| That's a job well done!

  |=============================================================================                                    |  68%

| Now use the R command points to plot May's wind and ozone (in that order) as solid blue triangles. You have to set the
| color and plot character with two separate arguments. Note we use points because we're adding to an existing plot.

> points(may$Wind, may$Ozone, col = "blue", pch = 2)

| You're close...I can feel it! Try it again. Or, type info() for more options.

| The code for solid blue trianges is 17 so typing points(may$Wind,may$Ozone,col="blue",pch=17) at the prompt should work.

> points(may$Wind, may$Ozone, col = "blue", pch = 17)

| Excellent work!

  |===============================================================================                                  |  70%

| Now create the variable notmay by subsetting airquality appropriately.

> notmay <- subset(airquality, Month != 5)

| You got it right!

  |================================================================================                                 |  71%

| Now use the R command points to plot these notmay's wind and ozone (in that order) as red snowflakes.

> points(notmay$Wind, notmay$Ozone, col = "red", pch = 8)

| You got it right!

  |==================================================================================                               |  73%

| Now we'll use the R command legend to clarify the plot and explain what it means. The function has a lot of arguments,
| but we'll only use 4. The first will be the string "topright" to tell R where to put the legend. The remaining 3
| arguments will each be 2-long vectors created by R's concatenate function, e.g., c(). These arguments are pch, col, and
| legend. The first is the vector (17,8), the second ("blue","red"), and the third ("May","Other Months"). Try it now.

> legend("topright", pch = c(17,8), col = c("blue", "red"), legend = c("May", "other Months"))

| Not quite! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Type legend("topright",pch=c(17,8),col=c("blue","red"),legend=c("May","Other Months")).

> legend("topright", pch = c(17,8), col = c("blue", "red"), legend = c("May", "Other Months"))

| You got it right!

  |====================================================================================                             |  74%

| Now add a vertical line at the median of airquality$Wind. Make it dashed (lty=2) with a width of 2.

> abline(v = median(airquality$Wind), lty = 2, lwd = 2)

| You got it!

  |======================================================================================                           |  76%

| Use par with the parameter mfrow set equal to the vector (1,2) to set up the plot window for two plots side by side. You
| won't see a result.

> par(mfrow = c(1,2))

| Nice work!

  |=======================================================================================                          |  77%

| Now plot airquality$Wind and airquality$Ozone and use main to specify the title "Ozone and Wind".

> plot(airquality$Wind, airquality$Ozone, main = "Ozone and Wind")

| You are amazing!

  |=========================================================================================                        |  79%

| Now for the second plot.

...

  |===========================================================================================                      |  80%

| Plot airquality$Ozone and airquality$Solar.R and use main to specify the title "Ozone and Solar Radiation".

> plot(airquality$Ozone, airquality$Solar.R, main = "Ozone and Solar Radiation")

| You got it right!

  |============================================================================================                     |  82%

| Now for something more challenging.

...

  |==============================================================================================                   |  83%

| This one with 3 plots, to illustrate inner and outer margins. First, set up the plot window by typing par(mfrow = c(1,
| 3), mar = c(4, 4, 2, 1), oma = c(0, 0, 2, 0))

> par(mfrow = c(1,3), mar = c(4, 4, 2, 1), oma = c(0, 0, 2, 0))

| Great job!

  |================================================================================================                 |  85%

| Margins are specified as 4-long vectors of integers. Each number tells how many lines of text to leave at each side. The
| numbers are assigned clockwise starting at the bottom. The default for the inner margin is c(5.1, 4.1, 4.1, 2.1) so you
| can see we reduced each of these so we'll have room for some outer text.

...

  |==================================================================================================               |  86%

| The first plot should be familiar. Plot airquality$Wind and airquality$Ozone with the title (argument main) as "Ozone
| and Wind".

> plot(airquality$Wind, airquality$Ozone, main = "Ozone and Wind")

| You got it!

  |===================================================================================================              |  88%

| The second plot is similar.

...

  |=====================================================================================================            |  89%

| Plot airquality$Solar.R and airquality$Ozone with the title (argument main) as "Ozone and Solar Radiation".

> plot(airquality$Solar.R, airquality$Ozone, main = "Ozone and Solar Radiation")

| Excellent work!

  |=======================================================================================================          |  91%

| Now for the final panel.

...

  |========================================================================================================         |  92%

| Plot airquality$Temp and airquality$Ozone with the title (argument main) as "Ozone and Temperature".

> plot(airquality$Temp, airquality$Ozone, main = "Ozone and Temperature")

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |==========================================================================================================       |  94%

| Now we'll put in a title.

...

  |============================================================================================================     |  95%

| Since this is the main title, we specify it with the R command mtext. Call mtext with the string "Ozone and Weather in
| New York City" and the argument outer set equal to TRUE.

> mtext("Ozone and Weather in New York City", outer = TRUE)

| You got it!

  |==============================================================================================================   |  97%

| Voila! Beautiful, right?
